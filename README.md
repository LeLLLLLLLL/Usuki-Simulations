Jupyter code for transport simulations.
input_ui.py produces a user interactive custom geometry maker. Once the user hits "View Transport," the Usuki calculations run and outputs the transmission and electron density files. outputs.py uses these files (tr_b.txt and waves.txt) to create a video file with the transport simulations.
